STREL-WORK is a streamlined machine learning framework built to label human activities and annotate potential stress levels based on physiological and motion data â€” including heart rate, cadence, and speed. Instead of predicting stress, the framework applies informed rules to label stress states from heart rate patterns, while supervised models classify physical activity.

It uses techniques like SMOTE and Group K-Fold Cross-Validation to handle imbalanced data and ensure solid participant-level separation for generalizable performance. The pipeline is optimized for real-world, participant-independent analysis.

This project supports researchers, health professionals, and engineers working on human behavior modeling, activity monitoring, and stress-aware systems. By turning raw sensor streams into labeled insights, STREL-WORK lays the groundwork for smarter, context-aware feedback tools.
